# Final Project

## Possible Ideas
1. Visualization of Gender Bias & Capitalism
* Implicit Association Test data on Gender-Career biases - do people associate career with men and family with women
* Implicit Association Test data on Gender-Science biases - do people associate science with women or men more
* Economic Freedom Index (Capitalism measure)
* Democracy Index
I would like to create a visualization of these 4 different datasets (or a combination thereof) to identify potential correlations between gender biases, capitalism and democracy. Ideally I would build machine learning models with this data but open to using other visual tools established in R.
